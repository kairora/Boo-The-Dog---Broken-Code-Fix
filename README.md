# Boo-The-Dog-Broken-Code-Fix

The module consisted of fixing broken code written about a dog named Boo.  The code included broken links, inserting and organizing paragraphs texts, coding buttons which would either shrink or grow images, change colors of text, or outut a random fact about Boo. There was also a broken image and an ordered list that needed to be fixed.
